# Smart Recommender Projects ‚Äì GenAI and Machine Learning

This repository contains a series of hands-on projects developed during the course **"Build Smarter Recommendation Systems with GenAI and ML."** The goal is to explore classic and modern approaches to building personalized recommendation systems, combining traditional machine learning with cutting-edge NLP and Generative AI techniques.

## üîß Technologies and Libraries Used

- Python, pandas, scikit-learn, NumPy
- Hugging Face Transformers (BERT, Sentence-BERT)
- Django (for full-stack deployment)
- Recommendation system techniques:
  - Content-Based Filtering
  - Collaborative Filtering
  - NLP + Embeddings
  - Clustering (K-Means, Gaussian Mixture Model)
  - Transformer-based models
